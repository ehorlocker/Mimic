# Mimic Game Engine

The beginning of a game engine! All it currently does is build with cmake and print some basic log statements with spdlog. Following [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1) for now with some minor differences. The readme will be updated as it goes. Note: This application is for WINDOWS ONLY at the moment.
