# Mimic Game Engine

The beginning of a game engine! Following [this series of youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1) for now with some minor differences. Currently on [layers!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kj6BSfM6P4&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=13) The readme will be updated as it goes. Note: This application is for WINDOWS ONLY at the moment.
